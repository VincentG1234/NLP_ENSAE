# ðŸ§  NLP ENSAE â€“ Query Rewriting Pipeline

This project provides a full pipeline for rewriting search queries to improve performance in retrieval systems (e.g., search engines, RAG). It includes:

- Synthetic data generation from public datasets (MS MARCO, Natural Questions, etc.)
- LLM-based query rewriting using Groq-hosted APIs or Hugging Face pipelines
- Fine-tuning of Flan-T5 models (with or without LoRA)
- Knowledge distillation from teacher to student models
- Evaluation, logging, and artifact tracking using Weights & Biases (W&B)
